The app where you search for consumer products and receive the closest location to obtain it from.

## Description

Nearest2U offers a simple and strong solution to the stressful problem of locating products. Instead of embarking on a tiresome search, all you need to do is input the name of the desired products into our app and in an instant, it not only identifies where you can purchase it but also provides directions to the nearest physical locations where it's available while also giving you the ability to reserve the product in advance.
