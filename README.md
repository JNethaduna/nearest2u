# nearest2u

![Logo](./static/Logo.jpg)

The app where you search for consumer products and receive the closest location to obtain it from.

## Description

Nearest2U offers a simple and strong solution to the stressful problem of locating products. Instead of embarking on a tiresome search, all you need to do is input the name of the desired products into our app and in an instant, it not only identifies where you can purchase it but also provides directions to the nearest physical locations where it's available while also giving you the ability to reserve the product in advance.

## Project Proposal

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You can skip any you've already done.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Go to this website and download the version marked as LTS(Long Term Support). _Check if Node.js is installed by running `node -v` in a terminal/console window._
- Code Editor - We are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Download and install Git. _You will need it to clone and contribute to the project._
- Package Manager - This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation). _To install pnpm, open a terminal/console window and run `corepack enable` then `corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate` If you're on windows and get an error that says "Running scripts is disabled on your system", open PowerShell as administrator and run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. This will allow the current user (you) to run local scripts and scripts signed by a trusted publisher._

### Clone the repository and install dependencies

1. Copy the link to the repository by clicking the green "Code" button at the top of this page.
2. Open a terminal/console window and navigate to the folder you want to clone the repository into.
3. Run `git clone <link>` where `<link>` is the link you copied in step 1.
4. Navigate into the cloned repository by running `cd nearest2u`.
5. Run `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies.
6. Open the project in your code editor.
7. Run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server.

### Workspace

I use VSCode and a few extensions to help me along. They are not required but I recommend installing them as it'll make the process smoother. If you use another editor please refer to a guide for that, as I have no idea.

VSCode Extensions

1. Prettier - Code Formatter
2. ESLint
3. Svelte for VSCode
4. Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
5. NPM Intellisense
